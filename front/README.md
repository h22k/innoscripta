# React

## Structure

I have created 3 types of components in there called `base`, `common` and `sections`. In base, you can find all the basic html elements, in common you will find what I have created for the design of the app using those base components and in sections you will see common components put together. You can find all the components I have mentioned inside of `src/components` .

I have also created some hooks for request processes that you can take a look in `src/hooks`. 
**But I haven't used them, I will explain the reason why in a bit**.

## Technologies

I have used `Tailwindcss`  for styling and `classnames` library to be able to give my components their own base styling and if needed some additional styling while using.
I have used `DaisyUI` for some guidance to create some components and easier styling purposes, 
but I was not happy with that decision and I will get into the reason in a bit too. 
I have also used `zustand` for the stage management.

## Not Ready
Front-side wasn't finished due to some health problems.
